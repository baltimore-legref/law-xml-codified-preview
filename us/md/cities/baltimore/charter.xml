Like the preexisting headings to sections, these are intended solely for convenience of reference.  They are not part of the Charter and should not be taken as affecting the meaning or effect of the law.  Cf. <cite path="I|§2|(m)">Article I, § 2(m)</cite>.</annotation>
    <annotation type="Editor's Notes">Charter amendments adopted after the 1994 Revision are identified in parenthesis at the end of the affected section or subsection.</annotation>
    <annotation type="Editor's Notes">This Edition of the Charter was proposed by Resolution 94-025, and ratified November 8, 1994.  Detailed legislative histories of enactments and amendments before 1949 are included in the 1949 Edition of the “Charter and Public Local Laws of Baltimore City”.  The reports of the Charter Revision Commissions that drafted the subsequent 1964 and 1994 Revisions are on file in the Library of the Department of Legislative Reference in City Hall.</annotation>

Provided, however, that the Mayor and City Council by ordinance passed not less than fifteen days before the change would become effective, may extend the period during which the one hour variation from standard time shall be effective in any year or years.  The extension may be to change the advance in time up to two o'clock a.m. on the last Sunday in March, or back to two o'clock a.m. on the last Sunday in October, or both such changes, or any portion or portions of either.  Any such extension may be provided only if other municipalities or sections of the United States shall have made such a change, and in the opinion of the Mayor and City Council thereby have caused inconvenience and annoyance to the commercial, economic, industrial or social affairs of the residents of Baltimore City.</text>

      <heading>Inner Harbor Park.</heading>
      <text>There is hereby dedicated to public park uses for the benefit of this and future generations of the City of Baltimore and the State of Maryland the portion of the City that lies along the north, west and south shores of the Inner Harbor, south of Pratt Street to the water's edge, east of Light Street to the water's edge and north of Key Highway to the water's edge, from the World Trade Center around the shoreline of the Inner Harbor to and including Rash Field, except that, in order to provide multi-family dwellings and off-street parking, eating places and other commercial uses, areas totalling not more than 4.5 acres plus access thereto, within the dedicated space and north of an easterly extension of the south side of Conway Street shall be set aside for such purposes, except that any areas used for multi-family dwellings and off-street parking are not dedicated as a public park; and except that in order to provide outdoor eating places for the areas known as West Shore Park and Rash Field, areas totalling not more than 0.5 acres within the dedicated space and south of an easterly extension of the south side of Conway Street shall be set aside for such purposes; and except that an area of not more than 3.4 acres shall be set aside for use by the Maryland Science Center, plus access thereto.</text>
      <annotations>
        <annotation type="Editor's Notes">
          <text>Ordinance 24-318, known as Ballot Question F, which was ratified on November 5, 2024, enlarged the permitted acreage for development within Inner Harbor Park from 3.2 to 4.5 acres. In addition, the Ordinance added multi-family dwellings and off-street parking to the list of permitted uses within this development space, but any land occupied by those two uses would no longer be part of the public park. Section 2 of the Ordinance states "[t]hat in enacting this Resolution of the Mayor and City Council, it is the intent of the Mayor and City Council to preserve the public park known as Rash Field and to preserve the existing development restrictions within the Inner Harbor Park south of Conway Street."</text>
          <text><strong>Litigation related to Ballot Question F.</strong> A group of 23 Baltimore City voters filed a petition for judicial review of Ballot Question F in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County alleging that Ballot Question F was invalid because (1) it was improper "charter material" in violation of Article XI-A, § 3 of the Constitution of Maryland and (2) the language of the question was not "easily understandable by voters" in violation of § 9-203(1) of the State Election Law Article, in addition to other claims. After the circuit court found that the measure could be included on the ballot but the votes for or against it could not be certified, the decision was appealed to the Maryland Supreme Court. The Supreme Court of Maryland issued a per curium order dated October 10, 2024, permitting the votes for or against Question F to be counted and certified.</text>

          <text>§ 9-113 of the Local Government Article (enacted as former Article 24, § 1-108, by Chs. 8 and 9, Acts of 1999) provides that “a candidate for chief executive officer [of a county] shall be a resident of the county for at least 6 months before the general election for chief executive officer” {LG §9-113(c)}.  By constricted definition and scope, however, this requirement applies to but two “counties” (Baltimore City and Montgomery County) and two “chief executive officers” (the Mayor of Baltimore City and the County Executive of Montgomery County) {LG § 9-113(a) and (b)}.</text>
          <text>The section further provides that a “county” may retain a Charter-imposed residency requirement that is longer than 6 months if that political subdivision “reaffirms the requirement by enactment of an Ordinance effective no later than 4 weeks before the filing deadline specified in § 5-303(a) of the Election Law Article” {LG § 9-113(d)}.</text>
          <text>In response to these provisions, the Mayor and City Council enacted Ordinance 99-433, effective June 1, 1999, to “reaffir[m] and retai[n] the residency requirement for Mayor that is imposed by <cite>the Baltimore City Charter</cite>”.</text>

The Board shall then state a rate for the levy of full rate property taxes sufficient to realize the amount required to meet the said difference and the ordinance making the annual levy of full rate property taxes shall fix a rate not less than that stated by the Board so that it shall not be necessary at any time for the City to create a floating debt to meet any deficiency, and it shall not be lawful for the City to create a floating debt for any such purpose.</text>

The amount of such annual pension to be allowed by the Board to each pensioner shall be equal to one-half the yearly salary received by members of the Department in active service in the same grade or occupying the same position as, or position most similar to, that occupied by the pensioner at the time of his retirement, payable in monthly installments.  The Board may also provide for the relief of widows and children of members of the Department who may have been killed in the discharge of their duties or have died as a result of injuries sustained in the performance of their duties, provided that the injuries were caused solely by risks taken in the performance of their duties and not due to the wilful misconduct of the deceased.</text>
        <text>The annual amount which shall be paid to the widows and/or to the children under the age of 18 years, of members of the Department who may have been killed in the discharge of their duties or have died as a result of injuries sustained in the performance of their duties shall be in the discretion of the Board, but shall not exceed the full amount of the yearly salary received by members of the Department in active service in the same grade and occupying the same position as, or position most similar to, that occupied by the deceased at the time of his death, payable in monthly installments.</text>
        <text>The Board may also provide for the relief of unremarried widows, by marriages existing at the time of retirement or death, of employees of the Department who are not members of the Employees' Retirement System or the Fire and Police Employees' Retirement System who die, whether death occurs before or after their retirement, subject to the Ordinance of Estimates.  The annual amount which shall be paid to such widow of such a deceased member shall not exceed fifty per centum (50%) of the yearly pension to which such deceased member would have been entitled to receive had that member lived and been retired under the provisions of <cite path="VII|§52">this section</cite>.</text>
        <text>The City Council may provide by ordinance a system of benefits payable to the unremarried widows and children under age 18 of persons who were employees or retired employees of the Department who were not members of the Employees' Retirement System or the Fire and Police Employees' Retirement System and who died or retired prior to June 7, 1963, subject to such exceptions, conditions, restrictions and classifications as may be provided therein.</text>

      <text>Whenever an ordinance is introduced into the City Council pursuant to the provisions of <cite path="VIII|§1">Section 1 of this Article VIII</cite>, which ordinance shall contain all the terms and conditions of the proposed grant, including a provision as to the rates, fares and charges, if the grant provides for the charging of rates, fares or charges, and a provision that the franchise or right shall be executed and enjoyed within six months after the grant, it shall, after the first reading, be referred forthwith to the Board of Estimates.  The said Board shall make diligent inquiry as to the money value of said franchise or right proposed to be granted and the adequacy of the proposed compensation to be paid therefor to the City as offered in said ordinance, and the propriety of the terms and conditions of said ordinance, and said board is empowered to increase the compensation to be paid therefor to the City and to alter the terms and conditions of said ordinance, including the space in or over which the franchise or right is proposed to be granted and the person to whom the franchise or right shall be granted, provided such alterations are not inconsistent with the requirements and provisions of the Charter, and it shall be the duty of said Board to fix in said ordinance the said compensation at the largest amount it may be able to obtain, by advertising or otherwise, for said franchise or right, and no grant thereof by the City Council shall be made except for the compensation and on the terms approved by vote or resolution of the said Board, entered in the minutes or records of said Board and attached to said ordinance with the signature of a majority of said Board signed thereto, and in the absence of such vote or resolution of said Board said proposed ordinance may not be passed but shall lapse and be void.</text>
      <text>Provided, that the right to use the streets, or other public property, by any person for steps, porticoes, bay windows, bow windows, show windows, signs, columns, piers, or other projections or structural ornaments of any character except so far as the same may be prohibited by law, and covered vaults, covered areaways, drains, drainpipes, or any other private purpose not prohibited by law or ordinance and not being a franchise or right requiring a formal grant by ordinance, may be granted by the Board of Estimates for such an amount of money and upon such terms as the said Board may consider right and proper without the necessity of an ordinance or advertising.  The applicant for any such right shall make written application therefor to the Board of Estimates, stating therein the use desired and the amount he proposes to pay therefor.  Before filing the application with the Board of Estimates, the applicant shall serve copies thereof on the owners of the adjoining properties.  The use applied for shall be enjoyed only on the payment of the consideration fixed by said Board and on the terms and conditions prescribed by it in writing, which terms and conditions, including the consideration charged therefor, may be changed from time to time by the Board — but with respect to "permanent" minor privileges, as defined in <cite path="VIII|§9">Section 9 of this Article VIII</cite> of the Charter, only after reasonable notice to the holder of the privilege and opportunity to him to be heard before the Board or its designated representative — and provided further, that all grants of minor privileges shall also be subject to the provisions of said <cite path="VIII|§9">Section 9 of this Article VIII</cite>.  The Board of Estimates may delegate to any department or other municipal agency, and such department or other municipal agency shall exercise, any administrative powers and duties relating to minor privileges.</text>

      <text>Regardless of the number of previous grants of a given franchise to its holder, or the number of years such holder may have held the same, the City may renew the same to him on the same or different terms from that theretofore granted, including an increase or decrease of the consideration or charge therefor, provided always, no grant by the City of a franchise or right in, over or under any part of its public property, whether an original grant or a renewal thereof, shall (save for a possible provision for renewals in accordance with the first sentence of <cite path="VIII|§3">this section</cite>) create a term therefor or a right to obtain a renewal of said term extending more than twenty-five years from the date of the ordinance granting or renewing the same, as the case may be.</text>
      <text>Any grant of a franchise may provide that upon the termination of the said franchise or right granted by the City, the plant, as well as the property of the grantee situated in, above or under the streets or other public property aforesaid with its appurtenances, shall thereupon be and become the property of the City, without further or other compensation to the grantee; or such grant may provide that upon such determination, there shall be a fair valuation of the plant and property, which shall be and become the property of the City at its election, on paying the grantee said valuation.  If, by virtue of the grant, the plant and property are to become the property of the City without money payment therefor, the City shall have the option either to take and operate the said property on its own account, or to renew the said grant for not exceeding twenty-five years on a revaluation or sell the same to the highest bidder at public sale.  If the original grant shall prescribe that the City shall at its election make payment for such plant and property, such payment shall be at a fair valuation of the same as property, excluding any value derived from the franchise or right and if the City shall make payment for such plant and property, it may, in that event, operate the plant and property on its own account for five years, after which it may determine either to continue such operation on its own account or to lease the said plant and property and the said franchise or right to use the streets, or other public property in connection therewith, for limited periods, not to exceed twenty-five years from the date of the grant, under such rules and regulations as it may prescribe, or to sell the plant and property to the highest bidder at public sale.</text>
      <text>Every grant of any such franchise or right shall make provision, by way of forfeiture or otherwise, for the purpose of compelling compliance with the terms of the grant, and to secure efficiency of public service at reasonable rates, and the maintenance of the property in good condition, throughout the full term of the grant.  The grant shall also specify the mode of determining the valuations and revaluations which may be provided for therein.</text>
