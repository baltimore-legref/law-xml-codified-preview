In making the determination, the actuary shall conclusively presume (whether actual or not) that the member has always been a covered employee under the Social Security Act and that the member's earnable compensation (as defined in § 1(11)), which would be treated as wages for purposes of the Social Security Act, has increased at a rate determined by the actuary, the amount to which the member is entitled shall not be reduced because of any Social Security entitlement by reason of a spouse, age of spouse, dependents, or any Social Security disability which the member, the spouse or dependents may suffer, or any Social Security, or Social Security offset income earned by the member.  For purposes of computing a member's primary Social Security benefit, if a Class C member has not reached the age of  65 years as of the date on which benefits are determined, City earnable compensation (as defined in § 1(11)), which would be treated as wages for purposes of the Social Security Act after his retirement or termination of employment, shall be deemed to be at the same rate as the rate in effect as of the date benefits are determined.</text>

        <text>The Board of Trustees may deny the right to become members to any class of elected officials, or any class of appointed officials, whose terms are fixed by law, or it may, in its discretion, make optional with persons in any such class their individual entrance into membership.  Any elected official or any appointed official whose term is fixed by law who is now a member or who hereafter becomes a member of the Employees' Retirement System may, at any time, resign from said system and be entitled, on demand, to the return of his accumulated contributions.</text>
        <text>However, such elected or appointed official, whose term is fixed by law, shall have the right at his option to continue membership in the Retirement System following the end of the term of office for which he was last elected or appointed.  Such right shall be contingent upon such person's making all the payments which would have been made by him and also by the City had he continued to hold such elective or appointive office.  Such payments shall be based on the current rate of compensation such person would have received, had he remained in office.  Within 30 days following the end of the term of office for which said official was last elected or appointed, in order to exercise such option, said official shall be required to deposit the remainder of all the payments in advance for the current fiscal year which would have been paid had he continued to hold such elective or appointive office.  Thereafter, such payments shall be made in annual amounts, in advance, within 30 days of the beginning of each and every fiscal year.  Such payments shall entitle said official to the same service credit that he was receiving as a member prior to his leaving office.</text>
        <text>Upon the attainment of age 60, such official shall be entitled to receive a service retirement allowance as provided for under the provisions of <cite path="|22|§6|(b)">§ 6(b) of this subtitle</cite>, computed as if he were a member retiring from service at age 60.  Should a member so electing die before attaining age 60, the amount of his accumulated contributions with interest to the date of his death shall be paid to his estate, or to such person as he shall have nominated by written designation duly acknowledged and filed with the Board of Trustees at the time of his retirement.  Such deceased member's beneficiary or his estate shall not be entitled to any benefit under this subtitle other than the return of the deceased member's accumulated contributions.</text>

        <para>
          <num>(1)</num>
          <text>Class A members shall be all new employees before July 1, 1979, who enter the membership on or after January 1, 1954, and any members in service on January 1, 1954, who elect on a form approved by the Board, to contribute at a rate of contribution computed to provide an annuity at age 60 of 1/120 of average final compensation, multiplied by the number of years of service after March 31, 1954.  Any school crossing guard, police department meter monitor or linemen transferred to this system pursuant to <cite path="|22|§30|(2)">§ 30(2) of this article</cite> shall be classified in this system as a Class A member, and shall not be charged with any deficit resulting from the difference in contribution rates between the Fire and Police Employees' Retirement System and this system in the calculation of said member's retirement allowance at the time of retirement.  The pension at service retirement on account of each year of prior service for Class A members shall be 1/60 of average final compensation, and the pension on account of each year of service since January 1, 1926 shall be 1/120 of average final compensation.</text>

          <text>Class B members shall be members in service on January 1, 1954, who do not elect, prior to April 1, 1954, to contribute at the higher rate applicable to Class A members.  The term "Class B members" also includes those members in service who do not become Class A members pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.  The pension at service retirement on account of each year of prior service for Class B members shall be 1/65 of average final compensation, and the pension on account of each year of service since January 1, 1926, shall be 1/130 of average final compensation.  Any time on or after December 1, 1975, any Class B member in the Retirement System may elect to become a Class A member.  Such election shall be contingent upon said member's depositing, by a lump sum payment or by an increased rate of contribution, the amount necessary to obtain an annuity savings account balance equal to the balance such account would contain if said member had elected to become a Class A member on January 1, 1954.  Said payments by the member to obtain Class A membership shall be paid in full 90 days before the effective date of his retirement.</text>

          <text>A disability retiree who has been certified as fit for further performance of his duties and is restored to active service at a compensation not less than the annual rate of compensation being paid currently to persons in the same grade and step as the retiree was at the time of his retirement, plus the amount of any longevity payments currently being paid for the length of service the retiree had at the time of his retirement, shall cease to receive his retirement allowance.  He shall again become a Class A or Class B member of the Retirement System and shall contribute thereafter at the current rate of contribution.  Any previous service credit on the basis of which his service was computed at the time of his retirement shall be restored to full force and effect and in addition, upon his subsequent retirement, he shall be credited with all his service as a member.</text>
          <text>Should such disability retiree who has been certified as fit for the further performance of his duties refuse to accept an offer of reemployment by the City involving duties in the nature of those he was performing prior to his retirement and at a salary not less than the rate of annual compensation being paid currently to persons in the same grade and step as the retiree was at the time of his retirement, plus the amount of any longevity payments currently being paid for the length of service the retiree had at the time of his retirement, all rights in and to his pension shall be revoked by the Board of Trustees, upon recommendation made by the panel of hearing examiners.</text>
          <text>Should such disability retiree refuse to submit to the medical examinations herein provided for, his ordinary disability retirement allowance may be discontinued until the withdrawal of said refusal, and should his refusal continue for 1 year, all rights in and to his pension shall be revoked by the Board of Trustees upon recommendation made by the panel of hearing examiners.</text>

          <text>A Class A or Class B disability retiree may, without reduction of his retirement allowance, earn annually an amount, hereinafter referred to as "earnings", equal to the rate of the annual earnable compensation currently being paid to persons in the same grade and step as the retiree was at the time of his retirement, plus the amount of any longevity payments currently being paid for the length of service the retiree had at the time of his retirement, said rate of earnable compensation plus longevity payments, if any, hereinafter referred to as "base amount". Should such a retiree earn an annual amount which is greater than his base amount, the pension otherwise payable to him shall be reduced in the following manner:</text>
          <text>For the first $5,000 of earnings in excess of the base amount, a reduction of $1 in pension benefits shall be made for each $2 earned.  For any earnings in excess of $5,000 over the base amount, a reduction of $2 in pension benefits shall be made for each $5 earned.</text>
          <text>In the calendar year of retirement, the base amount shall be prorated on a monthly basis.  Benefits which may be payable to a beneficiary of a deceased disability retiree under the provisions of this subtitle, shall not be reduced by reason of any excess earnings said retiree may have had; and the base for calculating said beneficiary's benefits shall be the total unreduced retirement allowance of the disability retiree, notwithstanding the fact that said retiree was receiving a reduced retirement allowance in the year of his death.</text>
          <text>The term "earnings" as used in this subsection shall mean income derived from wages, salaries, tips, commissions, other employee compensation, and self-employment.  In all cases of doubt the Board of Trustees shall decide what are and what are not "earnings" for the purposes of administering the provisions of this subsection.</text>
          <text>Such disability retiree who has not been certified as fit to perform duties in the nature of those he was performing prior to his retirement may, nevertheless, accept suitable employment with the City, subject to the "earnings" provisions contained herein; provided, however, that such an employee shall not again become a member of any retirement system supported in whole or in part by the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore.</text>

        <text>The Board of Trustees shall be the trustees of the several funds of the Employees' Retirement System of Baltimore created by <cite path="|22">Article 22</cite> under this subtitle as provided in § 8.  The Board of Trustees shall have the power to invest and reinvest such funds in the following types or classes of assets subject to the limitations, if any, as set forth with regard to each type or class of investment.</text>
        <text>The Board of Trustees has the duty and responsibility of periodically determining investment policies consistent with the capital market environment, and the actuarial characteristics of the Employees' Retirement System and to publish these investment policy guidelines by filing a copy of them with the Department of Legislative Reference.</text>
        <text>All contributions from time to time paid into the several funds, and the income thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall be held and administered by the Board of Trustees or its agents in the funds, and the Board shall not be required to segregate or invest separately any portion of the funds.</text>
        <text>Provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be deemed to render illegal or to invalidate the making and holding of any investment heretofore made and now remaining in said funds where such investment when made was authorized by law prior to the enactment of this section; and provided further, that nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent the Board of Trustees from accepting, in lieu or substitution of securities representing investments heretofore validly made, other securities not of the kind enumerated but authorized by ordinance as investments for the said Board prior to the enactment of this section, where the Board shall deem such substitution of securities desirable to preserve the investment of said funds.  Subject to the terms, provisions and conditions contained herein, said Trustees shall have full power to hold, purchase, sell, assign, transfer, and dispose of any of the securities and investments in which any of the funds created herein shall have been invested, as well as the proceeds of said investments and any moneys belonging to said funds.</text>

          <text>If a member dies before distribution of his or her retirement benefit begins, the member's entire benefit shall be distributed within 5 years after death.  This requirement is deemed satisfied by any distribution of the member's benefit payable to his or her designated beneficiary over a period not extending beyond the life or life expectancy of the beneficiary, as long as those distributions begin no later than December 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year of the member's death.  However, if the designated beneficiary is the member's surviving spouse, the date on which the distributions are required to begin is December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age 70½.  This paragraph (3) does not apply if distribution of the member's benefit began before his or her death and the remaining portion of the member's benefit is distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used at the date of the member's death.  Any amount paid to a child is treated as if it had been paid to a surviving spouse if that amount is paid to the surviving spouse when that child reaches the age of majority.</text>

          <text>The annual compensation of each member taken into account under this subtitle shall not exceed the federal Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ("OBRA '93") annual compensation limit.  The OBRA '93 annual compensation limit is $150,000, adjusted for cost of living increases under Internal Revenue Code § 401(a)(17)(B) and subject to the fresh start provisions set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection.  The cost of living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any period not exceeding 12 months over which compensation is determined (the "determination period") beginning in that calendar year.  If a determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period and the denominator of which is 12.  If compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's retirement benefit in the current year, the compensation for that prior determination period is subject to the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit for that prior determination period.  For this purpose, for determination periods beginning before July 1, 1994, the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit is $150,000.</text>

        <text>As of the end of each fiscal year, a determination shall be made of the amount of increase (if any) of retirement benefit payments which may be payable to eligible persons.  The amount of retirement benefit increase shall be calculated with reference to excess investment earnings of the Annuity Reserve Fund and the Pension Reserve Fund only, and according to the method described in subsection (c) below.</text>
        <text>After determination of the amount of excess investment earnings available for retirement benefit increases, such excess investment earnings shall be allocated to eligible retired members and beneficiaries according to the following method.

A percentage factor will be determined by the actuary to increase benefits to those eligible.

This requirement is deemed satisfied by any distribution of the member's benefit payable to his or her designated beneficiary over a period not extending beyond the life or life expectancy of the beneficiary, as long as those distributions begin no later than December 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year of the member's death.  However, if the designated beneficiary is the member's surviving spouse, the date on which the distributions are required to begin is December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age 70½.  This paragraph (3) does not apply if distribution of the member's benefit began before his or her death and the remaining portion of the member's benefit is distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used at the date of the member's death.  Any amount paid to a child is treated as if it had been paid to a surviving spouse if that amount is paid to the surviving spouse when that child reaches the age of majority.</text>

          <text>The annual compensation of each member taken into account under this subtitle shall not exceed the federal Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ("OBRA '93") annual compensation limit.  The OBRA '93 annual compensation limit is $150,000, adjusted for cost of living increases under Internal Revenue Code § 401(a)(17)(B) and subject to the fresh start provisions set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection.  The cost of living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any period not exceeding 12 months over which compensation is determined (the "determination period") beginning in that calendar year.  If a determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period and the denominator of which is 12.  If compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's retirement benefit in the current year, the compensation for that prior determination period is subject to the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit for that prior determination period.  For this purpose, for determination periods beginning before July 1, 1994, the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit is $150,000.</text>

        <text>The Board of Trustees shall be the trustees of the several funds of the Fire and Police Employees' Retirement System of Baltimore created by <cite path="|22">Article 22</cite> under this subtitle as provided in § 36.  The Board of Trustees shall have the power to invest and reinvest such funds in the following types or classes of assets subject to the limitations, if any, as set forth with regard to each type or class of investment.</text>
        <text>The Board of Trustees has the duty and responsibility of periodically determining investment policies consistent with the capital market environment, and the actuarial characteristics of the Fire and Police Employees' Retirement System and to publish these investment policy guidelines by filing a copy of them with the Department of Legislative Reference.</text>
        <text>All contributions from time to time paid into the several funds, and the income thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall be held and administered by the Board of Trustees or its agents in the funds, and the Board shall not be required to segregate or invest separately any portion of the funds.</text>
        <text>Provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be deemed to render illegal or to invalidate the making and holding of any investment heretofore made and now remaining in said funds where such investment when made was authorized by law prior to the enactment of this section; and provided further, that nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent the Board of Trustees from accepting, in lieu or substitution of securities representing investments heretofore validly made, other securities not of the kind enumerated but authorized by ordinance as investments for the said Board prior to the enactment of this section, where the Board shall deem such substitution of securities desirable to preserve the investment of the said funds.  Subject to the terms, provisions and conditions contained herein, said Trustees shall have full power to hold, purchase, sell, assign, transfer, and dispose of any of the securities and investments in which any of the funds created herein shall have been invested, as well as the proceeds of said investments and any moneys belonging to said funds.</text>
