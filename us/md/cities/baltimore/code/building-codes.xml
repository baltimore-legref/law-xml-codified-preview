Flat cables may not be stapled on edge.  Sections of cable protected from physical damage by a raceway need not be secured within the raceway.</heading>

          <text>Baseline IAQ testing shall be conducted after construction ends and prior to occupancy. Testing shall be performed using protocols consistent with the USEPA Compendium of Methods for the Determination of Toxic Organic Pollutants in Ambient Air, TO- 1, TO-11, TO-17, and ASTM Standard Method D 5197.  The testing must demonstrate that the contaminant maximum concentrations listed in Table 1001.7.2 3.1.5 are not exceeded in the return airstreams of the HVAC systems that serve the space intended for occupancy.  If the return airstream of the HVAC system serving the space intended for occupancy cannot be separated from other spaces, then for each portion of the building served by a separate ventilation system, the testing must demonstrate that the contaminant maximum concentrations at breathing zone listed in Table 1001.7.2 3.1.5 are not exceeded in the larger of the following number of locations: (i) no fewer than one location per 25,000 ft2 (2500 m2) or (ii) in each contiguous floor area.  For each sampling point where the maximum concentration limits are exceeded, conduct additional flush-out with outdoor air, and retest the specific parameters exceeded to demonstrate that the requirements are achieved.  Repeat procedure twice.  When retesting noncomplying building areas, take samples from the same locations as in the first test.</text>

        <heading>Scope  This Chapter specifies elective requirements for all projects.  It is designed to implement additional measures to support Baltimore City's sustainability goals, mitigate the impacts of building, and provide a greater benefit to the citizens of Baltimore City.  Electives are applicable to buildings, structures, and building sites subject to the provisions of this Code.  Owners have some flexibility selecting electives, but must adhere to the mandatory point provisions identified below.</heading>

Drain covers in splash pad zone surfaces must be flat and flush with the zone surface and must require tools for removal.  The manufacturer of the drain cover must certify that the covers comply with the physical testing and finger-and-limb entrapment requirements of Sections 3 and 6, respectively, of APSP 16.</text>

The tanks must be provided with a means to empty all water in the tank for the purposes of servicing or cleaning.</text>
