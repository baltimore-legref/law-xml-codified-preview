        <annotation type="Editor's Notes">
          <text>This subtitle was enacted by Ord. 99-388, effective July 1, 1999.  Section 3 of that Ordinance provides that the subtitle  “shall remain in effect unless the Maryland General Assembly enacts a Statewide tax on tobacco products; if a Statewide tax on tobacco products becomes effective, this Ordinance is abrogated and of no further force and effect, with no further action required by the Mayor and City Council.”</text>
          <text>After the enactment of Ord. 99-388, the General Assembly enacted Chapter 121, Laws of Maryland 1999.  Section 1 of that Act increases the rate of the preexisting tax on cigarettes; Sections 2 and 3 of the Act impose a new tax on certain other tobacco products.  Section 9, in turn, provides that Section 1 (the cigarette tax increase) becomes effective July 1, 1999; Section 8, on the other hand, provides that Sections 2 and 3 (the new Statewide tax on other tobacco products) only become effective July 1, 2000.</text>
