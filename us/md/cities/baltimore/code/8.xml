          <text>The following Part IV is shown as amended by Ordinance 18-198 (Bill 18-230) to require the filing of semi-annual, rather than annual, lobbying reports and to require that these reports be posted on the Ethics Board’s website for public viewing.  These changes, however, are subject to a special, delayed effective date.  As described in the relevant provisions of Section 3(a) of Ord. 18-198</text>
          <text>“The amendments made by this Ordinance to Part IV of Code <cite path="|8">Article 8</cite>, Subtitle 8, take effect ... on ... the 30th day after MOIT/BCIT has developed a viable, searchable online module that meets the criteria required by the Ethics Board and that will allow lobbyists to prepare and file their reports online, subject to the online payment of all attendant fees.”</text>
          <text>Progress to date suggests that the required online module will be completed and available for public use in June or early July, 2019.</text>
