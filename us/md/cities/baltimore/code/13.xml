        <heading>Notice to prospective tenant.</heading>
        <text>If any part of a rental unit, including the parking area or separate storage area for that unit, is within the Floodplain District, and the City has notified the landlord of that fact by first class mail, bulk mail, or otherwise, or the landlord has received notice of that fact from some other governmental agency, the landlord shall provide any prospective tenant with the following notice and acknowledgment:</text>
        <text>Notice to Prospective Tenant</text>
        <text>The rental unit you are to occupy or the motor vehicle parking area or separate storage facility you are to use (as the case may be) is situated in an area prone to flooding during unusually heavy or prolonged steady periods of rain.  Such flooding may damage personal belongings and motor vehicles.  Because of this possible loss, you may be eligible for U. S. Government subsidized flood insurance on the personal belongings in your unit.  In any event, because of this danger of loss of your personal belongings due to flooding, you may wish to consider acquiring flood insurance which may be purchased from some insurance agents.</text>
        <text>Damage to motor vehicles may not be covered by such insurance; therefore you may also wish to determine whether or not you have sufficient motor vehicle insurance to cover loss due to damage of your motor vehicle resulting from flooding in this area.</text>
        <text>The Baltimore City Department of Planning can provide information pertaining to the susceptibility of this area to flooding.  You may wish to contact that Department, at (telephone number), before signing either this acknowledgment or the lease agreement for this rental unit.</text>
        <text>Acknowledgment by Prospective Tenant</text>
        <text>I acknowledge reading and understanding the foregoing warning concerning flooding.  I have been provided time, prior to signing either this acknowledgment or a lease, to contact the Baltimore City Department of Planning concerning the susceptibility of the area around my rental unit to flooding.</text>

          <heading>Rental housing shortage.</heading>
          <text>The Mayor and City Council of Baltimore hereby finds and declares that a rental housing shortage presently exists in 2 areas of Baltimore City of emergency proportions which has been caused, in large part, by the conversion of rental housing to condominiums.  In addition, at the present time the number of conversions to condominium regimes is accelerating at a rapid rate.</text>

          <heading>Conversions exacerbating shortage.</heading>
          <text>These increasing numbers of conversions exacerbate an already severe shortage of moderate rental housing in the City while the poor economic conditions in the building trades have almost halted the construction of new rental units.  As a result, the Mayor and City Council finds that the combination of the conversion of existing rental units and the lack of construction of new rental units has resulted in an extreme scarcity of rental housing in the City and insufficient numbers of rental units available to low and moderate income tenants.</text>

          <text>The Mayor and City Council further finds that conversions of rental units has resulted in the displacement of tenants and caused these tenants severe financial and emotional stress in their need to relocate.  Studies have shown that elderly and handicapped tenants suffer serious emotional and physical disturbances when they are advised that their buildings are being converted into condominiums.</text>
