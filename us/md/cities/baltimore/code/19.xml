          <text>Oriole Park at Camden Yards was built to provide a place for major league baseball games to be played by the Baltimore Orioles baseball team for the benefit of fans of professional baseball in the Mid-Atlantic area.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(2)</num>
          <text>Oriole Park at Camden Yards was constructed pursuant to funding by the Maryland Stadium Authority and agreements between the Stadium Authority and the City of Baltimore.  In addition, state laws impose continuing duties to be performed by the City of Baltimore in conjunction with the operation of the stadium.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(3)</num>
          <text>The operation of the stadium is an economic benefit to the City and the State of Maryland.  A total sold-out season means the attendance of 4,600,000 fans in the City of Baltimore.  Those fans, between April and October, patronize businesses that provide employment for many citizens in the metropolitan area.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(4)</num>
          <text>These major league baseball fans expect to see major league baseball players playing at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.  Any player of less than major league caliber will be unacceptable to fans and will cause a substantial decrease in attendance.</text>

          <text>The recent position of the Commissioner of Baseball, at the request of the owners of the baseball teams to field non-major league baseball players in place of striking major league baseball players threatens the social and economic stability of the citizens of Baltimore and the Baltimore metropolitan area.  The Commissioner's proposal to withdraw the franchise of any major league baseball team that does not comply further threatens the social and economic stability of the citizens of Baltimore and Baltimore metropolitan area.</text>

        <text>An emergency has been created by a substantial increase in the number and in the seriousness of crimes committed by minors against persons and property within the City, and this has created a menace to the preservation of public peace, safety, health, morals, and welfare.</text>

        <text>The increase in juvenile delinquency has been caused in part by the large number of minors who are permitted to remain in public places and in certain establishments during night hours without adult supervision, and during daylight hours at times when, by law, they are required to attend school.</text>

        <text>Education is the foundation of success and a productive life.  The City of Baltimore provides the educational system and its staff, but the cooperation of students and their parents determines the productivity of the educational system.  Late evening activity by certain of our youth prevents them from concentrating in class or, even worse, causes their absence from class.  This, together with truancy, has risen alarmingly in recent years and youth is thus deprived of a necessary basic education.  The rate of absenteeism has risen alarmingly in recent years while the achievement rate has rapidly decreased.  The end result is an increase in failures and dropouts, frustration, malcontent, antisocial conduct, and, for many, a future without promise.</text>

      <para>
        <num>(4)</num>
        <text>The problem of juvenile delinquency can be reduced by regulating the hours during which minors may remain in public places and in certain establishments without adult supervision, and by imposing certain duties and responsibilities upon the parents or other adult persons who have care and custody of minors.</text>
