          <text>The Inner Harbor of the Patapsco River is the civic, financial, and symbolic heart of Baltimore City.</text>

        <para>
          <num>(2)</num>
          <text>The area fronting on the Inner Harbor (the "Waterfront") is home to many of Baltimore's largest employers.</text>

          <num>(3)</num>
          <text>The Inner Harbor is the center of tourism for the City and State, attracting over 12 million visitors a year.  It was the development of the Inner Harbor that first spawned the creation of a tourism industry in Baltimore, now considered to be the Baltimore area's seventh largest employer.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(4)</num>
          <text>The Waterfront is an important part of the City's tax base; the Inner Harbor alone contributed over $60 million in tax revenues to the City in 2005.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(5)</num>
          <text>The Waterfront is the site of some of the region's largest real estate investments and, as a result of the location and quality of development, many office tenants and residents are relocating here from outside the City.</text>

          <num>(1)</num>
          <text>The Waterfront is undeniably a tremendous asset to the region.  Still, to remain competitive as a destination, the Waterfront must be on a par with first-class destinations around the world.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(2)</num>
          <text>A study conducted by the Greater Baltimore Committee in 2005 concluded that "the Inner Harbor suffered from a complete lack of focus and attention to the quality of its facilities, supervision of responsibilities, and maintenance of the integrity of the harbor and its activities".</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(3)</num>
          <text>More specifically, the study focused on two key deficiencies: (i) the lack of a single person, government, or quasi-governmental entity that is charged with the specific oversight of the management and operation of the Harbor; and (ii) the lack of money or the influence to secure the needed manpower and equipment resources necessary to maintain the care and upkeep of the Inner Harbor properly.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(4)</num>
          <text>In 2006, a Task Force recommended that a business improvement or special benefits district be created that would advocate for, participate in, and financially support City and private sector efforts to create and maintain a world-class system of public and private parks, promenades, and open spaces in the Inner Harbor.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(5)</num>
          <text>In order to establish the Waterfront as a world-class destination, additional steps must be taken to create a consistently clean, attractive, easy to navigate, and appealing experience for residents, workers, and visitors along Baltimore's waterfront area.</text>

          <text>A special benefit district is a mechanism by which property owners within a defined area can agree to impose additional taxes and charges on themselves in order to provide enhanced and supplemental public services.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(2)</num>
          <text>Critical to the success of a benefit district is the creation of a partnership between the public and private sector, with the public sector committing to maintain services at specified levels and the private sector agreeing to accept new taxes and charges for the purpose of supplementing public services.</text>

        <para>
          <num>(3)</num>
          <text>The Council has considered the fact that, while the Waterfront Partnership of Baltimore, Inc., has operated successfully along the waterfront for approximately 18 months and has provided noticeable improvements to the attractiveness of the Waterfront and the overall experience for visitors to the Waterfront, the ability to provide a consistent set of services and to maintain a high quality standard requires a consistent and reliable funding stream.  The assessment system for a benefit district provides an uncomplicated, direct and fair funding process.</text>

            <num>(i)</num>
            <text>Household spending within the York Road Market Area is estimated at $265.9 million annually, and spending on food and drink is estimated at $29.9 million.  These estimates do not include spending by the area's sizeable student population.  It is also estimated that the Area presently captures only 29.8% of that total spending, with the remaining spending going to businesses elsewhere.  This disposable income in the local corridor marketplace would be captured within York Road with an expanded mix of appropriate businesses and services to meet the on-going needs of the local community.</text>

            <text>Given its largely built-out nature, the York Road Corridor operates within multiple constraints as regards to the attraction of new commercial/retail development opportunities.  In particular, land parcels along York Road are typically small, shallow, and in multiple ownership; arduous assemblage of parcels is typically required to accommodate the needs of many retailers.  There are few larger (2+ acre) parcels along York Road, and none are vacant land.  Over time the York Road Corridor will manage its real estate resources in such a way that uses along York Road will better serve the Market Area population, by attracting retailers who will serve unmet demand and by upgrading underutilized properties.</text>

          <text>Recommendation of the Plan:</text>
          <text>Establishment of a York Road Business Improvement District (BID) is recommended as the management entity for the Corridor.  In order to advance and ultimately achieve its full potential, the Corridor will profit from active management – a group specifically tasked to supervise day-to-day operations (e.g., sanitation, safety/security), but also tasked with longer-term, strategic efforts such as working with existing businesses to help them succeed, improving the business mix to grow sales, marketing the corridor to new businesses, and capturing real estate development opportunities as they occur.  The BID structure (as codified in State of Maryland and Baltimore City authorizing legislation) is focused on commercial issues, deriving its revenues principally from a mandatory assessment on commercial property owners, thus dedicating its attention to improving the Corridor's business environment.  The BID will also derive operating revenues from fee-for-service arrangements and grants from City government, foundations, etc., to provide various services that are better delivered locally.</text>

            <text>The growth of suburban shopping centers has threatened many neighborhood retail business districts.  Many cannot satisfactorily compete with new facilities that offer convenience, adequate parking, pleasing physical environment, diversification of retail services, and a management system that provides for promotional activities and for enhanced sanitation and security services.</text>

            <text>Retail sales in these neighborhood shopping areas have decreased, and the loss of revenue has caused a gradual disinvestment in the commercial properties, vacancies and, in the worst cases, abandonment by property owners.  This disinvestment negatively affects the surrounding residential community, results in the loss of jobs and property taxes to the City and requires the City to assume responsibility for these properties.</text>

          <text>To counter this trend Baltimore City established the Commercial Revitalization Program.

            <text>However, in order for neighborhood business districts to compete more efficiently for business with suburban shopping centers, funds and a management system are necessary to provide advertising and promotional activities and enhanced sanitation and security services for the entire district.</text>

            <num>(2)</num>
            <text>The Commercial Revitalization Program has always been founded on self-help by the business community.  The merchant associations in neighborhood business districts are voluntary organizations of business persons who have limited time to plan and implement a management program and limited capacity to raise funds.  They have indicated to the City a strong need for such a management program and fund raising mechanism.</text>

            <text>The management program created in this subtitle will harness the energies of the business community and provide it with the necessary funding through a Retail Business District License Fee.  Furthermore, the proposed program will enable all business establishments within the boundaries of a given Retail Business District to join in promotional, sanitation, and public safety efforts not economically feasible for many individual businesses without a program of this sort.  The City Council finds that this program serves a public purpose and enhances the general welfare of the citizens of Baltimore City.</text>

          <text>Tourism is a major contributor to Baltimore's economy, with visitor spending generating approximately $10 billion annually in total industry sales.  This activity generates $290 million in taxes and fees to the City of Baltimore annually, revenue that supports valuable City services, while also saving each Baltimore household $680 in annual personal tax contributions.</text>

          <text>Funding for Baltimore convention sales and tourism promotion is allocated by law to Visit Baltimore, Inc., a private and independent not-for-profit, non-stock corporation, in the form of a percentage share of the City hotel occupancy tax collection. This organization has been historically under-resourced in an increasingly competitive tourism market.  For example, market research quantifies a lack of overall awareness about and interest in Baltimore as a preferred tourism destination.  These challenges can be addressed through increased sales and marketing activities.</text>

          <text>Visit Baltimore is poised to deliver the enhanced marketing and sales infrastructure required to generate impact pending sufficient resources – and the hotel community has identified an opportunity for a self-funding and industry-managed mechanism, involving no new taxes for local residents, to support these programs.</text>

          <text>The ultimate goal of these programs will be to drive increased overnight visitation, in turn, supporting the bottom line of not only the city's hotel community, but also, benefitting all visitor-facing businesses as well as City residents through additional economic and quality of life benefits for the City of Baltimore.</text>

        <para>
          <num>(2)</num>
          <text>Tourism improvement districts have been created in over 160 destinations in 14 states across the country, and the reports received suggest that they are almost uniformly highly successful in achieving their objectives.</text>

          <num>(3)</num>
          <text>Critical to any tourism improvement district is the creation of a partnership between the public and private sector, with the public sector committing to maintain funding for tourism promotion services at specified levels and the private sector agreeing to accept new special assessments for the purpose of supplementing publicly funded tourism promotion services.</text>
