      <annotation type="Editor's Notes">
        <text>In the 1950 City Code, the then-provisions of this subtitle were codified as <cite path="|38" proof="needed">Article 38</cite>, §§47 through 58 {“Licenses and Numbers”}.  In the 1966 Code (legalized by Ord. 66-774, effective April 18, 1966), those provisions, as amended in the intervening years,  were recodified as <cite path="|31">Article 31</cite>, §§60 through 73 {“Licenses and Numbers”}.  In the same year, however, Ord. 66-887 was enacted, effective October 29, 1966, to  repeal all of <cite path="|38" proof="needed">Article 38</cite>, §§47 through 58  of the 1950 Code and to ordain a new §49 under the new subtitle “Licenses for Vehicles and Vessels”.  Neither of the 1966 enactments gave effect to the other.</text>
        <text>Whether Ord. 66-887 was ever given effect is uncertain.  That it was soon forgotten, though, is quite evident:  In 1975, the Mayor and City Council enacted Ord. 75-881, which amended <cite path="|31">Article 31</cite>, §§ <cite path="|31|§60" proof="needed">60</cite> through <cite path="|31|§73" proof="needed">73</cite>  of the 1966 Code (the same provisions as those that had been repealed by Ord. 66-887) and recodified them  as <cite path="|15">Article 15</cite>, §§92 through 105 under the current subtitle designation “Carriages, Wagons, Boats and Scows”.</text>
        <text>This recodification conforms to the later enactment, Ord. 75-881 (and subsequent amendments), and does not purport to give effect to the long-lost Ord. 66-887.</text>
