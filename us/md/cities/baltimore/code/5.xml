          <text>Costs of conducting electoral campaigns have increased significantly in recent years.  Many candidates are forced to finance their campaigns by seeking large contributions from individuals and entities who thereby gain disproportionate influence over governmental decision once the candidate holds office.  Qualified candidates without access to personal wealth or wealthy donor networks are often dissuaded from seeking public office.  Those that do run find it difficult to win with their voices drowned out in the media and on the ground.</text>

              <text>The purpose of this chapter is to establish a race- and gender-neutral remedy for ongoing effects of past discrimination in the marketplace by providing a variety of procurement tools for the City that will ensure that all segments of its local business community have a reasonable and significant opportunity to participate in City contracts for construction, architectural, and engineering services, professional services, services, and materials, supplies, and equipment.</text>

              <text>The SLBE Program also furthers the City's public interest to foster effective broad-based competition from all segments of the vendor community, including minority business enterprises, small business enterprises, and local business enterprises.  This policy is, in part, intended to further the City's compelling interests in both ensuring that it is neither an active nor passive participant in private sector marketplace discrimination, and in promoting equal opportunity for all segments of the contracting community to participate in City contracts.</text>
